# Todo

* ~~Add scrolling~~

* 

* Break shelf and book views out into files

* Add a few more stories to fill up shelf

* Add scrolling save progress

* Add crank input for scrolling, selecting books

* Add annotations

* Add book of user annotations

* Better font

## Bugs:

* takes a while to startup, I'm guessing the issue is parsing all the words out of stories at once

* right now you can scroll past the end of a book, causing the program to crash
