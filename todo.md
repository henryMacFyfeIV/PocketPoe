## Bugs:

* ~~takes a while to startup, I'm guessing the issue is parsing all the words out of stories at once maybe I can format the files like they are after the gmatch(), and just store those instead of the current txt file~~

* ~~right now you can scroll past the end of a book, causing the program to crash~~

* I've lost some text at the end of stories
