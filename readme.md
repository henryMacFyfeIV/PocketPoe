## Running PocketPoe
> rm -rf pocket Pocket\ Poe.pdx/ ; pdc source "Pocket Poe"; open Pocket\ Poe.pdx/ ; cp -r Pocket\ Poe.pdx/ ../../Disk/Games/

## Playing PocketPoe on your playdate
This repo contains a PocketPoe.pdx that can be added to your playdate [here](https://play.date/account/sideload/). 
I don't have a playdate yet, so PocketPoe may behave differently on actual hardware. If it does, please let me know.
