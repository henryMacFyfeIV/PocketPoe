# Readme

## Description
PocketPoe is a program for the [playdate console](https://play.date) that lets you read an assortment of short stories by author Edger Allen Poe.

## Running the program in playdate emulator with vscode
~~Download and setup your playdate sdk as described [here](https://sdk.play.date/1.11.1/Inside%20Playdate.html#_compiling_a_project).
I'm using vscode to build and debug PocketPoe with vscode extensions [Playdate by Orta](https://github.com/orta/vscode-playdate) and [Playdate Debug by midouest](https://github.com/midouest/vscode-playdate-debug).
After installing the sdk, vscode, and the two extensions, you should be able to run .vscode/launch.json with the vscode debugger. 
Alternatively, you can use the playdate compiler via the cli as described in the Inside Playdate doc linked above.~~ 
Scratch the above for now, vscode debug config got messed up, just run this to compile and run.
> rm -rf pocket Pocket\ Poe.pdx/ ; pdc source "Pocket Poe"; open Pocket\ Poe.pdx/

## Playing PocketPoe on your playdate
This repo contains a PocketPoe.pdx that can be added to your playdate [here](https://play.date/account/sideload/). 
I don't have a playdate yet, so PocketPoe may behave differently on actual hardware. If it does, please let me know.
